# SortedList
Assignment One for Software Design III (CS 340)

 SortedList is an implementation of a singly linked list 
 using Comparable to merge two lists into one ordered list.
 The list allows for two lists to be created, with an updating size
 and option to insert and remove items from the two lists while keeping
 the list fully sorted.
